# Linear-Regression-Scratch

Built a simple linear regression model from scratch built with PyTorch using only it's mathematical functions - includes the full data pipeline, model, loss function, and SGD optimizer
The code relies on tensors 
**Intention:** Creating a more hands-on approach to understanding the intuition behind linear regression models + learn a bit more about pytorch :)
